Reflection in C# is a powerful feature that allows you to inspect and manipulate metadata of types and members at runtime. It provides the ability to dynamically load assemblies, create instances of types, invoke methods, access properties, and more, without knowing the types at compile time.

Here's a brief overview of how reflection works in C#:

1. **Assembly Loading**: Reflection allows you to load assemblies dynamically at runtime using classes like `Assembly` and `Assembly.Load`.

2. **Type Inspection**: You can inspect types using the `Type` class, which provides methods to obtain information about constructors, methods, properties, fields, events, and more.

3. **Instantiation**: Reflection enables you to create instances of types dynamically using methods like `Activator.CreateInstance`.

4. **Method Invocation**: You can invoke methods dynamically using the `MethodInfo` class, obtained through reflection, along with `Invoke` method.

5. **Property and Field Access**: Reflection allows you to get and set property or field values using `PropertyInfo` and `FieldInfo` classes.

6. **Attribute Inspection**: Reflection provides methods to inspect attributes associated with types, methods, properties, etc., using classes like `Attribute` and `CustomAttribute`.

7. **Dynamic Code Generation**: Reflection can be used for dynamic code generation and manipulation, though it's more advanced and involves emitting IL code.

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use reflection to dynamically load an assembly, inspect its types, and create an instance of a type:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Reflection;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Load assembly dynamically
        Assembly assembly = Assembly.LoadFrom("ExampleAssembly.dll");

        // Iterate through types in the assembly
        foreach (Type type in assembly.GetTypes())
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Type: {type.FullName}");

            // Create an instance of the type
            object instance = Activator.CreateInstance(type);

            // Invoke a method dynamically
            MethodInfo method = type.GetMethod("ExampleMethod");
            method.Invoke(instance, null);

            // Access properties dynamically
            PropertyInfo property = type.GetProperty("ExampleProperty");
            property.SetValue(instance, "New Value");
            Console.WriteLine($"Property Value: {property.GetValue(instance)}");
        }
    }
}
```

Remember that while reflection is a powerful tool, it should be used judiciously due to its performance overhead and potential for runtime errors if not used carefully.
